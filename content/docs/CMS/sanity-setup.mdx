[Sanity](https://sanity.io/docs) is a headless CMS that allows you to create and manage content for your website. Indie Starter comes with a pre-configured Sanity setup that you can use for a blog section. You don't need to be familiar with Sanity if you want to make a customization to the blog section.

## Env Variables

To set up Sanity, you need to add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=your_dataset
```

These env variables are not mentioned in the `env.js` file, so you need to add them manually. they are the default setup for Sanity.

## Sanity Studio (Add Content)

To add content to your Sanity project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/studio` in your browser.
2. You will be prompted to log in. After logging in, you will access the Sanity Studio where you can add your content.

Make sure `localhost:3000` and your production domain `yoursite.com` are added to the `CORS Origins` in the Sanity dashboard under `API` tab.

## Schema Types

`src/sanity/schemaTypes` - This directory contains the schema types for Sanity. You can define the schema for your Sanity content in this directory.

`src/sanity/lib` - This directory contains the client for Sanity. You can use this client to fetch data from Sanity.
