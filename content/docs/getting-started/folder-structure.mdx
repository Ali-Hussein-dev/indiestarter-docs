import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

The folder structure might be a bit different depending on the plan you choose, the pro plan project contains more folders and files than the starter plan project.

The folder structur is conventional and simple, so you can easily navigate through the files and folders.

## Files and directories

- `app` - This directory contains the application's pages.
- `components` - This is where all reusable components are stored.
- `actions` - This directory contains server actions, which are functions that run on the server-side.
- `hooks` - This is where custom React hooks are stored.
- `lib` - This directory contains helper functions and third-party clients.
- `scripts` - This directory contains scripts that are meant to be run on Node.js.
- `types` - This directory contains global TypeScript type definitions.
- `env.js` - This file is used for managing type-safe environment variables.
- `sanity.config.ts`	Config file for Sanity Studio
- `sanity.cli.ts`	Config file for Sanity CLI

    <Folder name="components" />
    <Folder name="actions" />
    <Folder name="hooks" />
    <Folder name="sanity">

      <Folder name="stripe" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="scripts" />
    <Folder name="types">
      <File name="configs.ts" />
      <File name="db.types.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="sanity.config.ts" />
    <File name="sanity.cli.ts" />
    <File name="env.js" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

To import a file from the `src` folder you can use the `@/` alias, for example:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';
// also
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth'; 
// and last
import { supabase } from '@/configs';
```

You can customize the import alias in the `tsconfig.json` file.
