Learn how to define the global configuration of Indie Starter application with Next.js & Supabase
We store the global configuration of a Indie Starter application in `src/configs.ts`.

Within any application file, we can use the path `@/configs` to import it from any other file.

Explanation for each key is documented in the `src/types/configs.ts` file.

You can also add/remove keys as needed, but make sure to update the `src/types/configs.ts` file accordingly.
