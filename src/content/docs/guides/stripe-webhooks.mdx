## Setting Up Stripe Webhooks

Modify your webhook under the path `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` and configure actions for certain events â€“ like updating the DB or sending emails. Stripe has so many events that you can listen to, you can find the full list [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types). 

The most common events are 
- `checkout.session.completed` 
- `customer.subscription.updated`.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the Stripe CLI installed on your machine. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).

### Testing Webhooks

1. **Authenticate with Stripe CLI**

   Open a terminal and log in to your Stripe account:

   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the authentication process.

2. **Start Listening to Events**

   In a new terminal window, initiate listening to Stripe events:

   ```bash
   pnpm stripe:listen
   ```

   This command starts the Stripe CLI and listens for incoming webhook events.

3. **Trigger Test Events**

   To simulate a successful payment event, run:

   ```bash
   stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
   ```

   Upon triggering, you should observe log messages indicating the receipt of webhook events, similar to:

   ```bash
   ...
   2024-05-28 09:31:09   --> invoice.paid [evt_1OEpMPILOQf67J5TjrUgRpk4]
   2024-05-28 09:31:09  <--  [200] POST http://localhost:3001/stripe-webhook [evt_1OEpMPILOQf67J5TjrUgRpk4]
   ...
   ```

### Common Errors

- **Environment Variables Not Set**: Ensure all required environment variables are correctly configured.
- **Incorrect `price_id`**: Verify the `price_id` used in your requests matches one from your Stripe dashboard.
- **Missing `success_url` and `cancel_url`**: These URLs are essential for redirecting users upon transaction completion or cancellation.


## Best practices for using webhooks

- Handle duplicate events
- Only listen to event types your integration requires
- Handle events asynchrounously
- Verify events are sent from Stripe
