import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The folder structure might be a bit different depending on the plan you choose, the pro plan project contains more folders and files than the starter plan project.
The folder structur is conventional and simple, so you can easily navigate through the files and folders.

<FileTree>
- src
  - app
    - api/
  - components/
  - actions/
  - hooks/
  - lib
    - supabase/
    - stripe/
  - scripts/
  - types/
  - configs.ts
  - env.js
  - â€¦
</FileTree>

To import a file from the `src` folder you can use the `@/` alias, for example:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';
// also
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth'; 
// and last
import { supabase } from '@/configs';
```

You can customize the import alias in the `tsconfig.json` file.
