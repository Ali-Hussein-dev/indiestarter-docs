I made all the possible UI components that every project needs. You can find them in the `src/components` folder. Here is a list of all the components:

## Shared components

- Header
- Footer
- RootLayout with providers
- Auth components
- Loader for page route changes

## Pre-installed components (shadcn)

- Button
- Card
- Input
- Dropdown menu
- Avatar
- Accordion
- Badge

## Landing page components

- Hero
- Features
- Newsletter
- Pricing
- Testimonials

Additionally, legal pages are already included under the `src/app/legal` directory. You can find the following pages:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Imprint

{% callout type="note" title="Not for starter plan users" %}

Please note, if you're on the Starter Plan, certain components may not be accessible. For instance, landing page components are not included in this plan.

{% /callout %}
