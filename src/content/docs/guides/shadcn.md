Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

shadcn is already installed and some components are already available for you to use such as the `Button`, `Input` components. check the `src/components/ui` to see what components are installed.

If you want want to install additional components, you can run the following command in your terminal, I created a script in the `package.json` file that will install the component for you.

```bash
pnpm shadcn <component-name>
```
